# Lithnet User Verification Module for FIM 2010/MIM 2016
The Lithnet User Verification Module is an extension to the FIM/MIM portal that provides the ability for your help desk staff to validate a user using an SMS code sent to their mobile number.

If your users are already registered for SMS-based self-service password reset, then this module is ready to use.

## Features
1. Uses your existing [SmsServiceProvider.dll](https://github.com/lithnet/resourcemanagement-ui-userverification/wiki/Creating-an-SmsServiceProvider) that you created for SSPR one-time SMS passwords
2. Customize the list of attributes shown on the user verification page
3. Supports localized attribute names from the FIM/MIM service
4. Integrates with the user RCDC using a UocHyperLink control
5. Can be secured to only allow users of a set to access the tool

## Requirements
* SharePoint 2013 or later
* FIM 2010 R2 or later
* .NET Framework 4.0 or later

## Getting started
The module is a simple WSP package that needs to be deployed into your SharePoint farm. The [installation guide](https://github.com/lithnet/resourcemanagement-ui-userverification/wiki/Installation-and-upgrade-steps) covers all the steps for installing and upgrading the module

## Localization
The module will match the locale of the FIM portal, rendering attribute display names in the browser's preferred language. The module itself has been localized into the following languages
- Italian
- German (Thanks to Peter Stapf)
- Danish (Thanks to SÃ¸ren Granfeldt)
- Swedish (Thanks to Leo Erlandsson)
